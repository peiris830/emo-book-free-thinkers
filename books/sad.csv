Book,Author,About
Monkey's Birthday,Simon Crump,"The blackest of black humour covers the desperation in the lives of the characters in these three novellas. Characters at the bottom of the heap - vulnerable to circumstances, each other or themselves. It's a long time since I've 'enjoyed' such an unsettling read - not least because I can't quite believe that it's all as surreal as the blurb on the jacket claims!"
The Return,Andrey Platonov,"Ten stories of people on the move, fleeing from cruelty and poverty, yearning for death or a better life. Gruesome descriptions of want and pain make this a harrowing read. But the folktale style gives life to inanimate objects and transforms your experience of this bleak world."
The Last King of Scotland,Giles Foden,"Even though the book deals with an horrific period in Uganda's history, it does not dwell on the gory aspects, but instead gives you a broader view of life at the time. A dark, but compelling read."
Between Mountains,Maggie Helwig,"Set during the war in former Yugoslavia and the following war crimes tribunals, this is a story of how war gets under the skin and lies deep in the lives of those involved. In this case it is played out through the lives of Daniel and Lili, both brought together by war and now unable to let it go. A moving read and should be on a to-read list for anyone with an interest in the Balkans."
The Colour of Milk,Nell Leyshon,"14 year old Mary lives a very harsh life on her farther's farm in 1830. An unwanted and unexpected change in her circumstances allows her entry into a more refined and educated background but Mary pays a high price for the knowledge she gains. This is a very short novel, written in very basic language, grammar and punctuation, which succeeds in projecting Mary as a very interesting and well drawn heroine. An unusual and compulsive read."
My Name is Mary Sutter,Robin Oliviera,"For sheer bloody determination you can't beat Mary Sutter's resolute ambition to become a surgeon, amongst the battlefields of the American Civil War. Through intense hardship and total scepticism she strives against the odds, and at each pitfall she has my complete admiration. This is a story rich in period detail which evokes the desperately wretched atmosphere of the time. But I was still left wondering about the futility of all wars."
The Director's Cut,Nicholas Royle,"Four friends make an underground short film of a man's suicide. Fifteen years later the four are forced to meet again to examine their past actions and present relationships. This is the premise of a clever thriller set in a seedy and derelict London - with characters to match. The story flashes backwards and forwards in keeping with the cinematic theme, though I did find the first person narratives at the beginning and end jarred a little. But do keep reading because it all comes back together in a great twist I did not see coming at all!"
Helium,Jaspreet Singh,"Troubled academic Raj returns to India some 25 years after witnessing his Sikh Professor burned alive on a railway platform in the violent aftermath of Indira Gandhi’s assassination. This challenging and chilling novel often reads like non-fiction. It examines the impact of political actions, memory and responsibility on personal lives and how people come to terms (or not) with guilt and the horrors they experience."
Rainbow Milk,Paul Mendez,"A rags to riches story with an unexpected family twist at the end. A young, gay, black man and dedicated (‘a Disciple’) Jehovah Witness leaves his home in the UK Midlands to seek his fortune in London. Readers should be aware of the extremely graphic descriptions of the male gay scene. Great believable characters and very well described locations. A compulsive, constantly harrowing read but very well worth the concentration. Impressive debut."
The Shock of the Fall,Nathan Filer,This debut novel explores the journey of a young man into mental illness. It is a grim subject but the the brilliance of the writing makes for compulsive reading. I found the family dynamics so realistic - Matthew and Simon are real people not pegs on which to hang a tragic tale. Please don't be put of by the subject. It's a great book and deserved winner of the Costa 2013 Book of the Year Award
Mornings in Jenin,Susan Abulhawa,"Told through the voice of one family and primarily the youngest daughter, Amal, this is an unflinching account of the Palestinian experience from the birth of Israel to the end of the 20th century. The reader cannot help feel the anger, hurt, loss and the sense of isolation endured by Amal and her family - and her faith in family and friendship really makes you think about individual and personal stories at times of war and conflict"
The Madman of Freedom Square,Hassan Blasim,"Fantastical and macabre tales set in Iraq or following exiles as they attempt to build a new life. Inevitable violence and sexual references assault the reader, but nevertheless, there is a weird kind of humour that enables these disturbing stories to be read and even enjoyed."
New Finnish Grammar,Diego Marani,"A badly injured soldier, suffering from amnesia and unable to speak, is nursed to recovery and repatriated to another country. Following his agonising search to discover his roots, we discover the importance of story and language in shaping personal and cultural identity. With the backdrop of wartime Finland and forays into Finnish mythology, the novel explores themes of loss, alienation and the madness of war. One for serious reflection."
"Sing, Unburied, Sing",Jesmyn Ward,"Sad, brutal, tragic, poetic, demanding. Told in separate chapters by members of a black and mixed race Mississippi family; some of whom are ghosts (the 'Unburied' of the title). Whilst it can be read as a history of Southern black suppression, it is much, much more. The relationship of Jojo and his little sister Kayla brings some light relief. Seldom in literature have I encountered such realistic children. A worthy prizewinner and a must read"
The Lovely Bones,Alice Sebold,"An incredible book, this is the story of an horrific crime and its consequences on the family of the victim and the victim herself. In contrast to the reality, the tale is told with a gentle humour which is both poignant and touching. You must get past the horror of the main event to appreciate this unforgettable book."
The Law of Dreams,Peter Behrens,"Possibly the most powerful book I've read for many years – but it’s neither pleasant nor comfortable. The historical detail is spot on and the language is appropriately coarse and both combine to immerse the reader in the world of young Fergus. His is a life of unthinkable harshness. We feel his sadness and love for all those he has lost, both man and animal, keenly."
The Gypsy Goddess,Meena Kandasamy,I expected to loathe a novel that combines tragic recent history with discursions into the effectiveness of different writing styles. BUT this is an author who respects both her subject and her audience and I loved it. I really hope you will too.
Mr Shivers,Robert Jackson Bennett,A creepy suspense story of revenge which is set in the Great Depression in America. A fitting background for a sinister and chilling horror thriller which touches on the dark nature of mankind.
Bone China,Roma Tearne,"A lyrical and haunting tale of 3 generations fragmented by civil strife and the shock of migration. The genteel Grace De Silva faces upheaval as Ceylon is torn apart by independence and her children are compelled to seek a new life in austere England. Lost loves, secret sorrows and the search for cultural identity make up the sights and sounds of this novel. It’s a feast for the senses playing on the reader's emotions like a beautiful concerto."
Unfeeling,Ian Holding,"An uncomfortable book as its world is modern Zimbabwe seen mainly through the eyes of the 16 year old white farmer's son who survives his parents' massacre, feels responsible and has to act. A very uncomfortable book as it makes the reader aware too of the violence of the previous white rule by sjambok. A wonderfully well-written book that should be read as it portrays so clearly the plight of all of those who suffer when violent rule is the norm,whether it is rule by their father, their boss or, worst of all, the government."
